# FlutterIntegrationExample-android
FlutterIntegrationExample-android is a project that demonstrates how to integrate a Flutter application into an Android application. The project is an aid to an article written here on the same topic. There are two branches, starter and final. Checkout starter if you want to follow along with the article. Checkout final if you just want to see the final product of the article tutorial.
## Requirements
- Flutter installed on your device
- Android Studio installed on your device
- An understanding of Kotlin and Dart/Flutter
## Setup
To set up either the starter or final branch, simply cd into your cloned project and run `sh setup.sh`. Assuming Flutter is configured correctly on your device, you should then be able to run the app located in `FlutterIntegrationExample`.
